# Connway's Game of Life in SFML

### Introduction
My approach to Connway's Game of Life. Implemented in C++ and SFML.

### Usage
When executed from the command line, if no argument is provided, cells' width is set by default to 10 pixels. If the user wants to change it, needs to provide the size in pixels as the only argument for the program. This size should be between 1 and 100 (both included).

### Dependencies
While direct SFML dependencies have been included in the package, it still depends on dynamic libraries. Hence, it is required for the user to have SFML installed anyway.
